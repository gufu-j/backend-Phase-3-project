<h1> Backend Bakery Project </h1

This Project consists of building a backend, a database able to handle two tables, Bakeries, and Breads. 

The point of this project is to store or retrieve information with a front-end application.
Just as Bakeries have many breads, breads belong to different bakeries. Bakeries can have the same or different names and locations, and breads can be different in price, name, and type.
A logic to allow interaction between these two tables is developed here in order to allow a flow of data between the user at the frontend with the backend this is also known as CRUD interactions- Create, Read, Update, and Delete data. 
The table for bakeries has name and location information and the table for breads has the name, price, and type of bread. Tables were seeded with information done by the developer to start with, however, once the app frontend is built, that information is able to be updated, deleted, or even better add more information.
